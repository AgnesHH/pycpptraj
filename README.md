Welcom to pycpptraj!
====================

Aim: Write cpptraj wrapper for Python user
=========================================
- Short term goal: expose cpptraj library to Python
- Very long term goal: glue most of useful library in [AMBER] (http://ambermd.org/) by Python: 
    * tleap --> pyleap
    * paramfit --> pyparamfit
    * reduce --> pyreduce 
    * ParmedTools
    * (add many more)
- Why using pycpptraj:
    * It's fast
        * it's a wrapper of cpptraj (was written in C++ (by Daniel R. Roe))
        * it has interface with numpy. Data calculation are performed without copying to numpy array
        * (but it actually does not need `numpy` at all, just optional)
    * It has clean syntax
        * Python/Cython style with fancy indexing 
    * It has been extensively testes
    * It's flexible: 
        * you can write extension modules in either high (Python) or low (C/C++ or Cython) level

Status: pre-release version 0.1

Usage: 
=====
- Make sure to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH before using
    + export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$AMBERHOME/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- Check ./examples/
