Welcom to pycpptraj!
====================

Aim: Write cpptraj wrapper for Python user
=========================================
- Short term goal: expose cpptraj library to Python
- Very long term goal: glue most of useful library in [AMBER] (http://ambermd.org/) by Python: 
    * tleap --> pyleap
    * paramfit --> pyparamfit
    * reduce --> pyreduce 
    * ParmedTools
    * (add many more)
- Why using pycpptraj:
    * It's fast: it's wrapper of cpptraj, which was written in C++ (by Daniel R. Roe) with years of optimizing
    * It has clean syntax: Python/Cython are elegant
    * It's flexible: you can write extension modules in either high (Python) or low (Cython) level

Status: 
======
Several modules were finished. Check `./PYXLIST.txt`
    * ./examples/*.py

cpptraj paper: 
==============
[PTRAJ and CPPTRAJ] (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct400341p): Software for Processing and Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Trajectory Data
Daniel R. Roe and Thomas E. Cheatham, III
Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 2013 9 (7), 3084-3095 

Install
=======
- Install `libcpptraj.so` and move to $AMBERHOME/lib/
    * Read: install.txt
- Download pycptraj package:
    * git clone https://github.com/hainm/pycpptraj
- Change director to pycpptraj
    * cd pycpptraj/
- Install
    * python ./setup.py install
           * Install idividual module
               * cd ./pycpptraj
               * ./Install_single_file.sh Box.pyx
               * python ../examples/test_Box.py

Usage: 
=====
- Make sure to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH before using
    + export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$AMBERHOME/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- Check ./examples/

Version I am working:
=======
* Ambertools 14
* Python 2.7.8 :: Anaconda 2.1.0 (64-bit)
* Cython 0.21 and 0.22pre
* (use for write *.pxd *.pyx files) CppHeaderParser 2.4.3 (for parsing cpptraj header files)

Hacking
=======
Most of pxd files, test cases (and *pyx files too?) were generated by scripts I wrote in ./scripts_for_wrapping/
(It's better to use those scripts when Dan Roe updates/changes his cpptraj code)
