* Requirement
    * Compiling: cython + cpptraj
    * Running: pycpptraj

* numpy
    * pycpptraj does not depend on numpy but it does have limited feature numpy array-like
      for Frame instance (fancy indexing, ...)
    * to fully use numpy's power, you can expose Frame buffer like:
        * arr0 = np.asarray(frame.buffer) (arr0.shape = (frame.size, ))
        * arr1 = np.asarray(frame.buffer3d) (arr0.shape = (frame.size/3, 3))
